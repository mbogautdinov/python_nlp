J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"üö® THIS IS A MASTERCLASS: VP JD Vance just absolutely excoriated the whole premise behind globalism.

Future of the Republican Party right here. He says the solution to globalists' hunger for cheap labor in other countries is to bring back American innovation. He is RIGHT.

""Because there were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization. The first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea of globalization was that rich countries would move further up the value chain while the poor countries made the simpler things.""

""It turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects as you all well understand. The firms that design products work with firms that manufacture.""

""They share intellectual property. They share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end. We were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization.""

""I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it's a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it's a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now if you can make a product more cheaply, it's far too easy to do that rather than to innovate.""

""And whether we were offshoring factories to cheap labor economies or importing cheap labor through our immigration system - cheap labor became the drug of Western economies.""

""And I'd say that if you look in nearly every country from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you've seen productivity stagnate. And I don't think that that's not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct.""

""Now one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald's means more kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I'm not gonna comment on that here. Companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing.""

""I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You're worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day.""

""And so I I'd ask my friends, both on the the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I'd say that globalization's hunger for cheap labor is is a problem precisely because it's been bad for innovation.""

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"In this thread I'll respond to some of what I've seen out there. Let's start with Niall:

1) On the general background, yes, you have been more right than wrong on a lot of the details of the conflict. Which is why I'm surprised to hear you call the administration's posture ""appeasement."" We are negotiating to end the conflict. It is ""appeasement"" only if you think the Ukrainians have a credible pathway to victory. They don't, so it's not. 

2) As far as I can tell, accusations of ""appeasement"" hinge on a few arguments (not all of them from Niall, to be clear). The first is a criticism that we're even talking to the Russians. Well, the President believes to conduct diplomacy, you actually have to speak to people. This used to be called statesmanship. Second, the idea--based often on fake media reports--that we've ""given the Russians everything they want."" Third, that if we just passed another aid package, Ukraine would roll all the way to Moscow, raise Navalny from the dead, and install a democratic and free leader to Russia (I exaggerate, but only a little). All of these arguments are provably, demonstrably false. 

Many people who have gotten everything wrong about Russia say they know what Russia wants. Many people who know the media reports fake garbage take anonymously sourced reports on a complex negotiation as gospel truth. 

But the bigger issue, as I think Niall knows, is that most of those loudly shouting ""appeasement"" are people who aren't dealing with the reality on the ground. 

3) On the specifics of the negotiation, I""m not confirming details publicly for obvious reasons, but much of what I've seen leaked ranges from entirely bogus to missing critical info. The president has set goals for the negotiation, and I am biased, but I think he's awfully good at this. But we're not going to telegraph our negotiating posture to make people feel better. The president is trying to achieve a lasting piece, not massage the egos or anxieties of people waving Ukraine flags.

The idea that the President of the United States has to start the negotiation by saying ""maybe we'll let Ukraine into NATO"" defies all common sense. Again, it's not appeasement to acknowledge the realities on the ground--realities President Trump has pointed to for years in some cases.

4) Many of the subjective criticisms amount to pearl clutching that don't ultimately matter. I'm happy to defend POTUS's criticisms of the Ukrainian leadership (not that it matters, because he's the president, but I agree with him). You're welcome to disagree.

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"This is moralistic garbage, which is unfortunately the rhetorical currency of the globalists because they have nothing else to say. 

For three years, President Trump and I have made two simple arguments: first, the war wouldn't have started if President Trump was in office; second, that neither Europe, nor the Biden administration, nor the Ukrainians had any pathway to victory. This was true three years ago, it was true two years ago, it was true last year, and it is true today. 

And for three years, the concerns of people who were obviously right were ignored. What is Niall's actual plan for Ukraine? Another aid package? Is he aware of the reality on the ground, of the numerical advantage of the Russians, of the depleted stock of the Europeans or their even more depleted industrial base? 

Instead, he quotes from a book about George HW Bush from a different historical period and a different conflict. That's another currency of these people: reliance on irrelevant history.  

President Trump is dealing with reality, which means dealing with facts. And here are some facts:

Number one, while our Western European allies' security has benefitted greatly from the generosity of the United States, they pursue domestic policies (on migration and censorship) that offend the sensibilities of most Americans and defense policies that assume continued over-reliance. 

Number two, Russians have a massive numerical advantage in manpower and weapons in Ukraine, and that advantage will persist regardless of further Western aid packages. Again, the aid is *currently* flowing. 

Number three, the United States retains substantial leverage over both parties to the conflict. 

Number four, ending the conflict requires talking to the people involved in starting it and maintaining it. 

Number five, the conflict has placed--and continues to place--stress on tools of American statecraft, from military stockpiles to sanctions (and so much else). We believe the continued conflict is bad for Russia, bad for Ukraine, and bad for Europe. But most importantly, it is bad for the United States. 

Given the above facts, we must pursue peace, and we must pursue it now. President Trump ran on this, he won on this, and he is right about this. It is lazy, ahistorical nonsense to attack as ""appeasement"" every acknowledgment that America's interest must account for the realities of the conflict. 

That interest--not moralisms or historical illiteracy--will guide President Trump's policy in the weeks to come.

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"A statement from President Donald J. Trump and Vice President-Elect JD Vance:

The most foolish and inept thing ever done by Congressional Republicans was allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025. It was a mistake and is now something that must be addressed. 

Meanwhile, Congress is considering a spending bill that would give sweetheart provisions for government censors and for Liz Cheney. The bill would make it easier to hide the records of the corrupt January 6 committee‚Äîwhich accomplished nothing for the American people and hid security failures that happened that day. This bill would also give Congress a pay increase while many Americans are struggling this Christmas. 
 
Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we‚Äôd rather do it on Biden‚Äôs watch. If Democrats won‚Äôt cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let‚Äôs have this debate now. And we should pass a streamlined spending bill that doesn‚Äôt give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.
 
Republicans want to support our farmers, pay for disaster relief, and set our country up for success in 2025. The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling. Anything else is a betrayal of our country.
 
Republicans must GET SMART and TOUGH. If Democrats threaten to shut down the government unless we give them everything they want, then CALL THEIR BLUFF. It is Schumer and Biden who are holding up aid to our farmers and disaster relief.

But I want to say something about yesterday's news, and how it illuminates the difference between vigorous debate and violent rhetoric.

Here is what we know so far: Kamala Harris has said that ""Democracy is on the line"" in her race against President Trump. The gunman agreed, and used the exact same phrase. He had a Kamala Harris bumper sticker on his truck. He was obsessed with Ukraine's ""fight for Democracy"" and absorbed many unhinged views about the Russia-Ukraine war. HIs name is Ryan Routh, and he donated 19 times to Democrat causes and zero to Republican ones.

How do you think the Democrats and their media allies would respond if a 19-time Republican donor tried to kill a Democratic official? It's a question that answers itself. For years, Kamala Harris's campaign surrogates have said things like ""Trump has to be eliminated."" And how have their media allies responded to the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump in as many months?

NBC News called the attempted assassination a ""golf club incident."" The LA Times told us ""Trump Targeted at Golf Club."" The USA Today's top of the fold headline is ""Hope in America,"" and they published a preposterous letter to the editor arguing that Trump ""brings these assassination attempts on himself."" CNN's Dana Bash--who just yesterday bizarrely accused me of inciting a bomb threat--said today that Harris campaign rhetoric didn't motivate Routh even though he echoed their rhetoric explicitly.

PBS's weekend show perfectly illustrates the double standard of Kamala Harris's media friends. After spending 30 seconds on the second assassination attempt on President Trump, they then focused on the real danger: me and President Trump, who are, according to them, personally responsible for bomb threats against Springfield. Of course, I repeatedly condemend those threats. And reports today suggest they came from a foreign country, not--as the media suggested--a deranged Trump fan.

The double standard is breathtaking. Donald Trump and I are, by their account, directly responsible for bomb threats from foreign countries.  Why? Because we had the audacity to repeat what residents told us about the problems in their town. Meanwhile, Harris allies call for Trump to be eliminated as the media publishes arguments that he deserved to be shot.

This seems like a double standard. But at a deep level, it is entirely consistent.

Consider Springfield. Citizens are telling us that there are problems. These include the undeniable truths of higher car accidents, unaffordable housing, evictions of residents, overcrowded hospitals, overstressed schools, and rising rates of disease. They also include the infamous pet stories--which, again, multiple people have spoken about (either on video or to me or my staff).

Kamala Harris's first strategy was to ignore these people and their concerns. Yes, she had prevented the deportation of millions of illegal aliens, and some of them made their way to Springfield. But it was a small town with no voice. Some of the local leadership even loved the cheap labor. So the suffering of thousands of American citizens went ignored.

Their next move with these stories is censorship. In Springfield, a psychopath (or a foreign government) calls in a bomb threat, so they blame that on President Trump (and me). The threat of violence is disgraceful of course, yet the media seems to relish it. They cover a bomb threat, but not the rise in murders. They cover the threat, but not the HIV uptick. They cover the threat, not the schools overwhelmed with new kids who don't speak English. They cover the threat, not rising insurance rates or the car accidents that caused them. They cover the threat, not the failures of Kamala Harris's leadership.

The purpose is not to turn down the rhetoric. If anything, covering the bomb threats gives whoever makes them exactly what he wants: attention. The purpose is distraction and shame. How dare you talk about the problems of Haitian migration in Springfield? You're endangering people, simply by discussing the problems of Kamala Harris's policies. It's a form of moral blackmail, designed not to make anyone safe but to shut everyone up.

Springfield is the most recent, but hardly the most egregious example. There was the Hunter Biden laptop story, censored by BigTech. And who can forget that anyone who didn't support Kamala Harris's Ukraine policy was drenched in the blood of Ukrainian children. That last one appears to have had some effect on Routh--the most recent would-be assassin. The message is always the same: don't you dare express an opinion on the public affairs of your nation. The message is: shut up.

This is the difference between debate--even aggressive debate--and censorship. It is one thing to attack Kamala Harris for ""destroying the country"" and quite another to say that President Trump should be ""eliminated."" It is one thing to criticize overheated rhetoric, and another to say that a former president has invited an assassination on himself. It is one thing to say that Donald J. Trump's arguments about the election of 2020 are wrong; it is another thing to attempt to remove him from the ballot over it.

It is one thing to say that pets are not, in fact being eaten, and another thing to say that anyone who disagrees is trying to murder people. Dissent, even vigorous dissent, is a great tradition of the United States. Censorship is not.

For the next 7 weeks of this campaign, I will vigorously defend your right to speak your mind. I believe you have every right to criticize me and Donald J. Trump, even if you say terrible or untrue things about us. But when I ask you to ""tone down the rhetoric"" it's not about being nice--our citizens have every right to be mean, even if I don't like it--or empty platitudes.

Instead, I'm asking all of us to reject censorship. Reject the idea that you can control what other people think and say. Embrace persuasion of your fellow citizens over silencing them--either through the powers of Big Tech or through moral blackmail.

I think this will make our public debate much better. But there's something else. Reject censorship and you reject political violence. Embrace censorship, and you will inevitably embrace violence on its behalf.

The reason is simple. The logic of censorship leads directly to one place, for there is only one way to permanently silence a human being: put a bullet in his brain.",1726565280,"17,998","54,334","6,776","210,891"

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"If you were to ask what caused me to change my tune about President Trump from 2016 to 2020, I could give you a few reasons. But what we're seeing in Springfield really drives it home. 

Housing costs skyrocketing. Communicable diseases on the rise. Car accidents, crime, and insurance premiums moving up. Citizens complaining for months (or longer) and mostly ignored.

But it's not just what's hapening, it's the way our leadership responds to it. Confronted with many of their citizens begging for relief, our broken elites offer only scorn. 

""It is racist,"" they tell us, to get angry at being unable to afford a home, or to complain about being unable to drive a car safely down the streets paved by your neighbors,  or to call 911 because strangers are slaughtering geese in a public park.  They have ignored this town's problems for years.  Now, they pay attention--not to focus their considerable wealth and power on helping their fellow citizens. 

But to use their platform as a weapon against those who dare to notice that their lives have gotten worse. 

""They are here legally,"" they tell us. Yes, they are here legally because Kamala Harris granted Temporary Protective Status to 100,000 Haitians. But Kamala Harris waving the magic amnesty wand is not a justification for the presence of 20,000 newcomers in Springfield. It is an indictment of her despicable open border. 

Nothing justifies violence or the threat of violence levied against Springfield or its residents. We condemn both. But the existence of threats doesn't justify silencing those who wish to petition their leadership for a better life. There is no heckler's veto in our country. Donald Trump was shot in the head, and yet they still call him a ""threat to democracy.""

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"8) Kamala Harris has said she wants to support veterans and their families. She has completely failed to do so as Vice President:

Right from the beginning, Biden and Harris charted a bad course, putting U.S. soldiers in harm's way. In Afghanistan, as the situation turned chaotic in 2021, a lot more could and should have been done to keep our people safe. People on the ground warned Biden and Harris - through a dissent channel cable - that the situation would get chaotic. The administration didn't listen. And so when the time came to move our people out of Kabul, we ended up running the operation out of Kabul's own airport, right in the city. It was chaos, and ISIS terrorists exploited that chaos to murder 13 U.S. service members at Abbey Gate on August 26, 2021.

And the thing that gets me is this: Kamala Harris never once bothered to pick up the phone and call those families. Kamala Harris never once supported an investigation into the decisions that led to Abbey Gate. If Kamala Harris cared about veterans, she would have demanded accountability. She didn't.

I think our veterans and their families deserve a genuine investigation into what happened at Abbey Gate. That's about accountability, yes, but it's also about making sure it doesn't happen again.

The same mistakes that led to our losing people at Abbey Gate were repeated again and again and again. At Tower 22 in Jordan on January 28, 2024, we lost three service members to a drone launched by an Iran-backed militia. Different time, different place, different enemy - but a lot of the same mistakes. By that time, our forces had been under fire in Syria and Iraq dozens, hundreds of times since October 7 - and we weren't shooting back. The situation was chaotic, we weren't in control, it was only a matter of time before our people paid the price.

Take your pick of military operations under this administration - from the pier to nowhere in Gaza to the Red Sea operation against Houthi militants, the common thread running through them is our soldiers get thrown into situations where they are sitting ducks, where they very often come to serious harm, with no serious thought given to how we're going to get the other side to stop shooting at us.

That absolutely has to stop, and it will stop under President Trump. When Russian forces attacked us in Syria on President Trump's watch, we killed them. When we took on ISIS in the Middle East, we destroyed them. Our goal should never be to send our troops into harm's way as some kind of symbol of resolve. We send our troops in to win. That's how it should be.‚Å©",1725962940,609,"3,061",113,"18,028"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"7) Kamala Harris says she wants to secure our borders. Her record tells a different story:

Harris touts her record prosecuting international criminals as California‚Äôs Attorney General. One of the reasons why California has so much migrant crime is because it is a sanctuary state that shields illegal aliens from deportation. Hence foreign criminals feel more protected in California. Another thing Attorney General Harris did as California‚Äôs AG was write a 2015 letter to the US Senate defending California‚Äôs sanctuary state policies and opposing a bill that would penalize the state‚Äôs noncooperation with federal immigration law. It is safe to assume that there would have been a lot fewer migrant criminals to prosecute in California if the state and AG Kamala had allowed ICE agents to do their jobs and deport them.

Kamala Harris then claims to have supported a bipartisan border security bill that would have deployed more agents and drug scanners. I believe she is referring to Sen. Chris Murphy‚Äôs Border Act of 2024 (S.4361). What she won‚Äôt tell you is that the bill also codifies catch-and-release, allows up to 1.8 million illegals to enter before the border could be closed, gives billions of taxpayer dollars to the same NGOs that are driving the invasion and expands the executive parole powers used by Biden instead of limiting them. The bill‚Äôs author Sen. Murphy put it best when he admitted that, under his bill, ‚Äúthe border never closes.‚Äù I think all of that is totally unacceptable when our nation is facing a historic border crisis, which is why I and my Republican colleagues opposed it. Kamala Harris should have instead pushed for a standalone vote on new border agents and scanners.

Kamala Harris also brags that, thanks to her efforts, border crossings are currently at 4-year lows. It is worth remembering that almost four years ago, on their first day in office, Biden and Harris issued executive orders that stopped border wall construction and stopped deportations. They then rescinded Trump‚Äôs Remain In Mexico policy, allowing every migrant with a dubious asylum claim to enter America while waiting in an years-long case backlog. As a direct result of these actions, America endured consecutive months record-breaking illegal immigration. Only once their Border Act was rejected, and border security consistently polled as a top concern of voters, did Biden and Harris issue orders that give the appearance that they care about illegal border crossings. She cannot take credit for nominally lower border crossing numbers after she spent almost four years holding the border wide open.

But the most destructive part of the Kamala Harris border plan is where she says that she wants to give her 8.5+ million illegal aliens an ‚Äúearned pathway to citizenship,‚Äù which means rewarding illegal aliens with amnesty and the right to vote in our next election. Promising amnesty and citizenship will create a gigantic magnet for illegal immigration that will entice people around the world to race across our borders.

If there‚Äôs a takeaway from this section, it‚Äôs that Kamala opened our borders to 8.5+ million illegal aliens, lied about it for almost four years, blamed others when she got caught and now wants to reward those illegals with citizenship.‚Å©",1725925740,342,"3,920",75,"16,301"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"6) Kamala Harris made it clear that she views American energy policy as a part of her wider fight against global warming. For example, she takes credit for passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which she claims lowered household energy costs while building a green energy economy. The reality of the IRA‚Äôs climate record, however, is much different.

CBS News reported earlier this month that the cost of electricity has increased more than 28.5 percent since 2019, with the average American now paying nearly $300 each month just in utilities. These higher costs can be attributed to a shrinking supply of American electricity. More specifically, Harris's environmental policies have shuttered reliable coal power plants, slowed the approval of new natural gas plants and failed to enact permitting reform for American generation and transmission infrastructure. Instead, they have placed an increasing burden on less reliable sources of energy, such as solar and wind. These renewable sources are more dependent on conducive weather than coal and gas plants, which means they are most prone to failure exactly when Americans are most reliant on electricity to do things like heat their homes. Kamala‚Äôs energy policies are making Americans poorer and more vulnerable to extreme weather.

As for the ‚Äúnew green energy economy,‚Äù let us look at the IRA‚Äôs effort to make American roads more conducive to electric vehicles. The IRA allocated $7.5 billion to build new EV charging stations along highways. In the almost two years since the IRA became law, the Biden-Harris administration has built just eight charging stations. This program is part of the wider Harris push to replace gas-powered cars with EVs, which has also fizzled. Many automakers, including Ford and General Motors, are delaying or curtailing EV rollouts amid lower-than-expected consumer demand, despite rosy predictions from administration officials and $7,500 federal tax credits to buy new EVs. Meanwhile, dealers are complaining that they cannot move the EV inventory they already have.

Kamala Harris also pledges to advance ‚Äúenvironmental justice‚Äù and pays fealty to international climate agreements. At best, the policies spawned by progressive and foreign ideologues will go the way of the EV push: billions of tax dollars wasted with American energy and auto workers left with uncertain futures. At worst, Kamala‚Äôs climate policies will increase energy costs for all Americans, degrade their standard of living with new climate mandates, leave them vulnerable to dangerous weather and make America a worse place to live.

We all want cleaner air and water. What we do not want is more climate hysteria.‚Å©",1725924180,144,"3,290",40,"14,791"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"5) Kamala says she wants to invest in affordable child care, but again that's not what her plan would do:

As I‚Äôve said before, I want our public policy to increase access to affordable childcare options and empower parents with the flexibility and resources to make the best childcare decisions for their family.

Harris says that she wants families to ‚Äúafford high-quality child care.‚Äù That may sound nice, but as always, Harris is light on detail and heavy on slogans. What might she mean by this?

It‚Äôs tough to say, but the best indication would be the national childcare plan that she‚Äôs already laid out with President Biden as par of their ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan. We all know how those policies turned out: skyrocketing inflation.

But the childcare provisions of their plan were so extreme that not even a Democrat-controlled Congress could pass them. They wouldn‚Äôt have worked for many American families.

Most parents who use a paid childcare center say they prefer a faith-based provider. What would Harris‚Äôs plan do for them? Nothing. Childcare providers based in a house of worship would have been excluded from funding opportunities. Other faith-based providers would be subject to additional regulations in order to access funding that might not have been able to meet.

Many parents prefer to stay at home with a young child or have a loved-one watch them. Would Harris‚Äôs plan support these families? Not at all. Her proposal was only supports childcare centers and would offer no support to families that prefer not to send their children to daycare.

Ensuring families have access to affordable childcare is an important challenge for our policy to help tackle. But the answer cannot be to force families into Kamala‚Äôs preferred one-size-fits-all model. We can support parents and their children without leaving millions of families behind.‚Å©",1725912060,143,"2,909",55,"15,383"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"4) Kamala Harris claims she wants to make our education system a pathway to the middle class.

Take it from me, a working-class kid who went to Ohio State on the GI Bill and then to Yale: education can absolutely be pathway to the American Dream. But I‚Äôm not naive enough to think that our current system works for everyone. It obviously doesn‚Äôt. Fewer than one-in-five American students goes smoothly from high school to college to a career that uses their degree.

Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt want to address these problems. Instead, she wants to double down on the failures of our education system. She wants taxpayers to write off more student loans, to increase subsidies that will only drive up tuition costs, and to send even more money to some of the worst-performing universities in the country.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to know: What will Harris say to Pennsylvania ironworkers who are upset that they have to pay for someone else‚Äôs college degree?

The answer, I‚Äôm afraid, is absolutely nothing. Kamala Harris, like the rest of our education establishment, treats the majority of hard-working Americans without a college degree as an afterthought. We‚Äôre the only developed country in the world without a distinct, vocational education pathway, and yet Kamala Harris thinks the solution is to send even more money to universities.‚Å©",1725893820,147,"2,857",51,"17,328"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"3) Vice President Harris claims she'll ""take on the everyday obstacles and red tape that can make it harder to grow a small business.""

However, under her administration, the SEC has promulgated at least 47 rulemakings, the majority of which have not been mandated by Congress, and we've seen Treasury enact burdensome compliance regulations, with some even aimed at small businesses, like the Administration's preferred implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act.

This doesn't sound like cutting red tape to me. It sounds like the opposite: enacting overbearing regulations that stifle innovation and kill job creation.",1725887340,147,"3,131",41,"18,358"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"2) Kamala claims she wants to make rent more affordable and home ownership more attainable, but that's not what her plan would do at all.

Kamala wants to give every first time homebuyer a $25,000 check toward downpayment assistance. What she fails to leave out is that this would likely raise the average home price by the same amount, making her plan moot. We also haven't heard how the debt-burdened federal government would pay for such a plan.

There‚Äôs also no guarantee that this down payment assistance will be limited to citizens. The campaign has yet to lay out what requirements there will be, beyond being a first time homebuyer and having a two year history of rental payments. One reporter has indicated that only an SSN or taxpayer identification number will be required. If that‚Äôs true, then this would leave open the door for millions of illegal immigrants to get this assistance. And this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time housing assistance has gone to noncitizens‚Äîthere are a number of federal housing subsidies that noncitizens are eligible for: including the HOME Investment Partnership Program and Treasury‚Äôs pandemic era Emergency rental assistance program.

But under Kamala, the potential for assistance to go to illegals isn‚Äôt the only issue. Couple that with Kamala‚Äôs CFPB and DOJ effectively forcing banks to lend to noncitizens. They‚Äôve rewritten guidance mandating that banks cannot deny loan applications strictly on citizenship grounds, even though citizenship and residence status bear a large impact on loan repayment prospects.

Vice President Harris also mentions how she'll spur the construction of ""3 million more rental units."" While she outlines an admirable plan, it's tough to take it seriously. This Vice President has overseen an administration that has enacted new red tape for multi-family and single-family construction. We've seen her Housing and Urban Development Department enact green energy requirements for new rental units, mandatory strictly-cosmetic updates to public housing units, and more regulations that will make it harder to grow the rental supply.

That's not the end of it. The Vice President seems to think that the ongoing housing crisis is strictly due to a supply problem, but it's not. Her policies have also driven demand for housing through the roof, particularly when looking at the price and availability of rental units.

As I've outlined before, and as academic research supports, mass immigration drives up demand, threatens the American dream of homeownership, and makes housing less affordable for working Americans.

When a city‚Äôs immigrant population increases, the area‚Äôs home prices and rental costs rise by a comparable amount. But the effects vary by neighborhood: home values are negatively correlated with the immigrant concentration. The result: only current homeowners in non-immigrant, wealthy neighborhoods stand to benefit from mass immigration. Working-class residents see their rental costs soar, and their home values decline.

It's common sense, we can't fix our housing crisis until we address the crisis at the border.‚Å©",1725887340,341,"3,433",100,"21,994"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"‚Å®‚Å®1) Kamala Harris claims she wants to cut taxes for middle class families, but here's what's in her plan:

IRS Audits for working families: Getting audited is a horrendous experience, even if you‚Äôve done nothing wrong. Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to hire 87,000 IRS agents to audit more people. As recently as last summer, 63% of new audits fell taxpayers earning less than $200,000.

The IRS, like Kamala Harris, claims that it‚Äôs not going to increase audits on people making under $400K, but the Treasury Inspector General stated the agency‚Äôs strategic plan, ‚Äúdid not include specifics on how the IRS was going to ensure it met this commitment.‚Äù That‚Äôs because they have no intention of ensuring they‚Äôre not going to audit middle class families‚Äîthat‚Äôs where they‚Äôre going to find the money to pay for their massive spending proposals.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, under questioning in the House, could not deny that 90 percent of new audits under the IRA would be on households earning less than $400,000. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that the majority of additional taxes the IRS recommended from audits from 2010-2021 came from taxpayers with income less than $200,000.

It‚Äôs even harder to pretend that taxing working men and women isn‚Äôt their focus when you think about the reporting requirement Biden-Harris signed into law to require businesses to fill out a 1099K form on transactions over $600 made using third-party payment platforms. The reporting threshold before their bill was $20,000.

There‚Äôs no minimum number of transactions in their bill, so a single transaction over $600 that triggers the reporting requirement creates more paperwork. Even Senate Democrats have backed different bills to blunt the impact of this enormously burdensome mandate.

The Government Accountability Office found this aspect of the Harris tax record would result in at least 30 million new 1099K forms getting sent out in 2024.   The Joint Committee on Taxation found that over 90 percent of the tax burden will fall on middle class families and gig workers.

The Biden-Harris tax plan, as explicitly outlined in their formal budget request to Congress would increase taxes by $5 trillion.   That‚Äôs going to stack on top of her inflationary climate spending bills and drag the economy down further.  It‚Äôs been estimated that ‚Äúthe tax changes in the Biden-Harris budget would reduce long-run GDP by 1.6 percent‚Ä¶wages by 1.1 percent, and employment by about 666,000 full-time equivalent jobs.‚Äù

That‚Äôs nearly a million people out of work and lower wages for everyone in order to shift money towards the Harris Green New Deal‚Äîas she said to CNN in her first interview after nearly a month as the Democratic nominee, her values haven‚Äôt changed on that policy, which she supported enthusiastically when she was in the Senate.

All in all, the Biden-Harris record has been a massive wealth transfer from working people to the Green New Deal‚Äôs constituencies‚Äîthe Harris tax plan is going to be more of the same, no matter what kind of claims she makes during the campaign.‚Å©",1725887340,397,"4,040",188,"25,833"

And he will put an end to the Biden Administration's war on crypto. Onward!",1718901900,"1,330",JD Vance retweeted,281,"20,304"
J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"I just donated $1 million in bitcoin (15.47 BTC) to @realDonaldTrump and will be voting for him in November. Here‚Äôs why:

Over the past few years, the Biden Administration has openly declared war against crypto. It has weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it. This Administration's actions have been nothing short of an unprecedented abuse of power wielded entirely for twisted political gain at the complete expense of innovation, the American taxpayer, and the American economy. There is nothing the Biden Administration can do or say at this point to pretend otherwise.

Some of the lowlights include the following:

The weaponization of the banking system against crypto companies and their principals. Known colloquially as Operation Choke Point 2.0, this starts with the OCC (a federal agency that licenses and regulates national banks) and the FDIC (a federal agency that provides deposit insurance to banks) giving ‚Äúguidance‚Äù and instructing banks behind closed doors not to bank crypto companies. Any bank that doesn‚Äôt follow orders is threatened. 

The conversation goes something like this: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a nice bank you got there. It sure would be a shame if something were to happen to it because you bank some crypto folks.‚Äù If this tactic is not enough to scare a bank into line, the examiners will be sent in to turn everything upside down. This will almost certainly lead to some ‚Äúfinding‚Äù ‚Äî show me the bank and I‚Äôll show you the crime ‚Äî that results in a massive fine or new supervisory rules and conditions that cripple a bank‚Äôs ability to operate. The risk is simply too great. Banks can either choose not to bank crypto companies or have that choice made for them.

These agencies have God-mode over banks because they can yank their license or FDIC deposit insurance at any time citing ‚Äúsafety and soundness‚Äù concerns. That is why they can behave like characters out of the Godfather and intimidate banks into dropping any customer or customer segment they want. This behavior of de-banking entire industries that are completely legal, but ideologically out of favor, began during the Obama Administration, when President Joe Biden was Vice President. It was nicknamed Operation Choke Point 1.0 back then and is a well-documented stain on the Obama Presidency. The Biden Administration has dusted off the playbook and has been running it at full speed against the crypto industry. 

The blast radius has extended beyond crypto companies to individuals who work at them. I personally have lost multiple bank accounts because I own crypto and my investment firm @winklevosscap has as well.

The weaponization of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto. The Biden Administration‚Äôs SEC has not written a single rule for the crypto industry to help any of its participants understand how to navigate the regulatory landscape for this new asset paradigm. This is by design. 

By not writing any new rules for crypto, the SEC can disingenuously say that the existing rules ‚Äî based on a 1946 Supreme Court decision about a citrus grove in Florida, issued before most homes had a telephone and 50 years before the advent of the commercial Internet ‚Äî are fit for purpose. They are not.

Here‚Äôs one example. If ether is a security, an open question up until 48 hours ago, then you would be breaking securities laws if you sent ether to a friend from your smartphone to their smartphone. Why? Because only a broker dealer is allowed to transfer a security. And it can only do so to another broker dealer. From this example alone, anyone can understand how classifying a crypto like ether as a security would gut its utility and destroy its ability to usher in a decentralized future. It‚Äôs like asking an automobile to behave like a horse. Yet that is the position the Biden SEC has taken towards almost every crypto. It does this not because it doesn‚Äôt understand the consequences, but because it does. These are exactly the consequences it wants. To kill crypto.

By taking the ridiculous position that almost every crypto is a security, the Biden SEC has given itself the plausibility and carte blanche to bring litigation against any crypto project and company in the United States. The game is simple. Make it impossible to comply, then sue everyone for not complying. And that‚Äôs exactly what the Biden SEC has done over and over again to good actors in the space. Instead of the SEC hashing out rules for crypto ‚Äî something that could be done in a matter of days ‚Äî rules will be written years from now by judges and juries who determine that the SEC acted in bad faith and was wrong all along. The time and economic waste will be tremendous. The damage will be done. But that‚Äôs the point.

The Biden Administration has polluted the mission and corrupted the integrity of these agencies. All of them are led by unelected bureaucrats appointed by President Biden to carry out his marching orders. The moral compass of these foot soldiers is political gain and their higher calling is political power. Congress never granted them the statutory authority to determine the fate of the crypto industry or any other legal industry in America and they are totally unqualified to act as the gatekeepers of economic life in our country. That is the role of the market.

And yet the crypto industry is not alone. The Biden Administration has consistently attacked American business across the board and villainized its greatest heroes. The crime is always success and the reward is always ridicule, fines, and even more red tape. But to be clear, the Biden Administration doesn‚Äôt hate success outright. Only the kind that lives outside of its control. Once it figures out how to confiscate or coerce it, the Biden Administration becomes quite enthusiastic about success, gleefully manipulating it or redistributing it in a transparent attempt to buy votes. Over a long enough time scale, it's easy to see how these policies will lead to the destruction of our economy and our country.

Capitalism lifts people up. When allowed to flourish properly, it is the greatest generator of wealth and prosperity the world has ever known and it's the only economic system that can achieve all of this peacefully, while upholding the freedom and dignity of every individual who participates. With certain conditions in place ‚Äî like the ability for anyone to incorporate a company, open a bank account to accept customer payments, and operate in the open market without government interference ‚Äî innovation and wealth creation will thrive unbounded. Remove any one of these building blocks and you will have an entirely different system with entirely different results. This is exactly what the Biden Administration has done to the crypto industry and many other industries in America. It has been dismantling our economic way of life and the system that made America the greatest country in the world. And it has done this solely for its own power, control, and political ambition.

Of all the capitalist experiments, America has been the greatest. I have seen and experienced this first hand many times. @Gemini, a crypto platform I founded in 2014 with @cameron, went from an idea on a napkin to becoming a company that has employed thousands of people over the last decade and helped millions of customers gain access to crypto. I‚Äôve had employees thank me in tears because their time at Gemini allowed them to buy a house for their family. I‚Äôve had customers approach me on the street and thank me for building Gemini because it helped them achieve financial freedom and start their own business. It is these experiences that give me the greatest joy and provide meaning for everything we do at Gemini. The Biden Administration has tried to tear all of this down. I am not going to stand by idly and let them. I‚Äôm going to continue fighting for what I know to be so right.

President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice. This is not even remotely open for debate. Anyone who tells you otherwise is severely misinformed, delusional, or not telling the truth. It‚Äôs time to take our country back. It‚Äôs time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington. That attacking us is political suicide. This is why I will be casting my vote for President Trump in November and I hope you will too. Onward!",1718900940,"3,986","3,225","1,131","42,691"

J.D. Vance,JDVance,Republican,"Why I‚Äôm Backing President Trump

As many press accounts have reported, I‚Äôm hosting a fundraising event for President Donald J. Trump at my home in San Francisco this evening.

Over the last couple of years, I have hosted events for presidential candidates Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as several Congressional figures in both major parties. I give to many, but endorse few.

But today I am giving my endorsement to our 45th President, Donald J. Trump, to be our 47th President. My reasons rest on four main issues that I think are vital to American prosperity, security, and stability ‚Äì issues where the Biden administration has veered badly off course and where I believe President Trump can lead us back.

1. The Economy

President Biden took over an economy that was already recovering strongly from the Covid-induced shock of Q2 2020. Demand had roared back, and employment had recovered. But he chose to keep priming the pump with unnecessary Covid stimulus ‚Äì almost $2 trillion of it, passed on a straight party-line vote in March of 2021, with trillions more to follow for ‚Äúinfrastructure,‚Äù green energy, and ‚Äúinflation reduction.‚Äù

Biden did this despite early warnings from former Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers that it could lead to inflation. When the inflation came, the Biden administration dismissed it as ‚Äútransitory.‚Äù In fact, inflation still remains persistently high even after the fastest interest-rate tightening cycle in memory.

As a result of Biden‚Äôs inflation, average Americans have lost roughly a fifth of their purchasing power over the last few years. Moreover, any American who needs a mortgage, car loan, or credit card debt faces much higher interest costs, which further constrain their purchasing power.

It‚Äôs no different for our federal government, which now must devote over a trillion dollars annually to interest on its $34 trillion debt, a massive sum that‚Äôs been growing by a trillion dollars every hundred days. This trajectory is unsustainable, yet Biden‚Äôs 2025 budget calls for even higher spending.

Growth has already slowed from 3.4 percent in the last quarter of 2023 to an anemic 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year. We can‚Äôt afford another four years of Bidenomics.

2. Foreign Policy / Ukraine War

President Trump left office with ISIS defeated, the Abraham Accords signed, and no new wars raging on the global stage. Three and a half years later, the world is on fire. President Biden has made several strategic choices that have contributed to this situation.

In his first year in office, Biden unnecessarily alienated the Saudis before realizing that they are an indispensable partner in the Middle East. He also presided over a chaotic withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan (right policy, abysmal execution).

But his biggest blunder by far has been in Ukraine. His administration immediately began pushing for Ukraine‚Äôs admission to NATO, despite no unanimity among the existing NATO members that such a move was a good idea. When this predictably antagonized the Russians, the Biden administration doubled down at every turn, insisting that ‚ÄúNATO‚Äôs door is open, and will remain open‚Äù with respect to Ukraine. Biden himself baited Russia when he said he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúaccept anybody‚Äôs red lines.‚Äù

After the invasion, there was still a chance to stop the war in its early weeks before much loss of life and destruction had occurred. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators had signed a draft agreement in Istanbul that would have seen Russia retreat to its pre-invasion borders in exchange for Ukrainian neutrality. But the Biden administration rejected that deal as well as General Milley‚Äôs advice to seek a diplomatic solution in November 2022.

As the war of attrition grinds on, the Ukrainians face ever-mounting casualties and infrastructure damage. Still, President Biden keeps allowing the conflict to escalate and risk World War III. Every escalation that Biden initially resisted ‚Äì Abrams tanks, F-16‚Äôs, ATACMs, allowing Ukraine to hit targets in Russia ‚Äì he has eventually acquiesced to. There is just one more escalation to go: NATO troops on the ground fighting Russia directly. And our European allies like Emmanuel Macron are already spoiling for exactly this scenario.

With Biden, our choices are limited to fighting the proxy war to the last Ukrainian, or fighting Russia ourselves. President Trump has said he wants the dying in Ukraine to stop, and that he will seek to end the war through a negotiated settlement. Ukraine will no longer be able to get the deal we talked them out of in April 2022, but we can still save Ukraine as an independent nation and avert world war.

3. The Border

As an immigrant to the United States myself, I certainly believe in America‚Äôs history of strengthening its ranks by welcoming talented people from other nations seeking freedom and opportunity. But that promise requires an orderly process of legal immigration that emphasizes skills and the principles of American citizenship. This was the preferred policy under President Trump.

What Biden ushered in was a de facto open border policy. On his first day in office, he repealed President Trump‚Äôs executive orders restricting illegal immigration and stopped construction of a border wall, selling off parts of it for scrap metal. This quickly resulted in a massive spike in illegal border crossings and a chaotic and dangerous situation on our southern border.

President Biden (along with the hapless Kamala Harris and the malevolent Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas) responded to growing concerns by gaslighting the American public, saying there was no problem at the border despite constant videos of masses of people sprinting across it.

When the situation became too dire to ignore or deny, Biden claimed he didn‚Äôt have the executive authority to do anything about it and blamed Republicans for not sending him legislation. But this week, facing abysmal polling numbers on this issue, Biden suddenly discovered he has executive authority after all. The order he signed is a tepid, too little-too late effort to slow the tidal wave of illegal immigration in time for the election. But Biden has shown he is not serious on this issue. If he wins a second term, the open border policy will resume, and tens of millions more illegals will stream across the border.

4. Lawfare

A bedrock of the political stability we‚Äôve enjoyed in America over the last 250 years is that we don‚Äôt accept attempts to jail political opponents in order to win an election. Yet Biden has pushed for selective and unprecedented prosecutions of his once and future opponent from the moment he assumed office.

Merrick Garland took a long look at the January 6 situation and didn‚Äôt see a path to prosecute Trump, even after a one-sided Congressional committee sent a highly-prejudiced referral to his Justice Department. Press stories then appeared describing Biden‚Äôs frustration with Garland‚Äôs reticence. The result was Jack Smith at the federal level and Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis at the state level. All have pursued cases based on novel legal theories heretofore unseen and designed to get Trump. In the NY case, Bragg resurrected a dead book-keeping misdemeanor into 34 felonies by claiming it was in the service of a second crime that he never defined and that the judge never insisted the jury unanimously agree on.

My immigration to this country as a young boy happened because my parents disagreed with the political system of their home country. That government sought to solve its political disagreements by imprisoning its political enemies. What a sad irony that the lawfare we escaped has now reared its ugly head in America of all places.

President Biden keeps insisting that a return of President Trump to the White House threatens democracy. But his administration is the one that has colluded with tech platforms to censor the Internet, used the intelligence community to cover up his son Hunter‚Äôs laptop, and pursued elective prosecutions against his political opponents.

Conclusion: The A/B Test

The voters have experienced four years of President Trump and four years of President Biden. In tech, we call this an A/B test. With respect to economic policy, foreign policy, border policy, and legal fairness, Trump performed better. He is the President who deserves a second term.",1717859220,"10,386",174,"3,488","86,675"

Black men and boys deserve a president who sees them, and will help break through the barriers preventing them from building intergenerational wealth and realizing their aspirations.

Donald Trump is not that president.

Trump‚Äôs business career began when he was investigated for refusing to rent property to Black families. His entry into public life was when he took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of the Central Park Five‚Äîinnocent Black teenagers who were later exonerated. As president, he called majority-Black nations ‚Äúshitholes.‚Äù

Today, Trump‚Äôs Project 2025 agenda would give him unchecked power, posing an even more serious threat to Black communities. He would bring back stop-and-frisk, roll back civil and voting rights, and implement a national sales tax costing families an average of $4,000 per year.

Kamala Harris,KamalaHarris,Democratic,"On January 6, Donald Trump incited an attack on our nation‚Äôs democracy because he didn‚Äôt like the outcome of the election. Armed with weapons and animated by Trump‚Äôs lies, insurrectionists invaded the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn a lawful election.

The January 6 Committee exemplified a bipartisan effort to safeguard our democracy and preserve our most sacred freedoms for generations to come‚Äîled by Republicans like @Liz_Cheney and @AdamKinzinger, who chose to put country over party‚Äîalongside Democrats. 

The oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States is sacred and must always be upheld‚Äînever violated. The most fundamental question in this election is: Who will obey that oath?

I have sworn that oath to uphold the Constitution six times throughout my career‚Äînot only as Vice President or as a U.S. Senator, but also as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. I have never wavered in upholding that oath, and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation.

Therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me.

Anyone who, like Donald Trump, violates that oath‚Äîwho recklessly tramples on our democratic values, who actively tries to overturn the will of the American people, or who has called for the ‚Äútermination‚Äù of the Constitution‚Äîmust never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.

The vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land.

Kamala Harris,KamalaHarris,Democratic,"This week, I was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to discuss how we will strengthen our economy and chart a new way forward. There‚Äôs an old saying that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. That is the story of the Steel City. A city that helped build the middle class, birth America‚Äôs labor movement, and empower the rise of American manufacturing and innovation. 

We have an extraordinary opportunity at this moment. An opportunity to make our middle class the engine of America's prosperity; to build a stronger economy where everyone, everywhere, has a chance to pursue their dreams and aspirations; and for the United States of America to continue to out-innovate and out-compete the world. 

That is why I created our Opportunity Economy Agenda. It would increase the tax deduction for startups by ten times to $50,000‚Äîbecause no one can start a business on $5,000. We have set an ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of the first term, and we will strengthen our small businesses owners and entrepreneurs, the backbone of America‚Äôs economy. 

We will also invest in the industries like the ones that made Pittsburgh the Steel City. We will offer tax credits to strengthen factory towns‚Äîretooling existing factories, hiring locally, and adding good union jobs‚Äîbecause no one who grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. We will also invest in emerging technologies to make sure America, and not China, are at the forefront of innovation. 

The proud heritage of Pittsburgh reveals the character of our nation: A nation that harnesses the ambitions, dreams, and aspirations of our people‚Äîand seizes the opportunities before us. That is what we have always done. And that is what we must now do.",1727614740,"3,472","1,985",183,"8,883"

Joe Biden,JoeBiden,Democratic,"In the face of increasing threats to America‚Äôs democratic institutions, I am calling for three bold reforms to restore trust and accountability to the Supreme Court and our democracy.

First, I am calling for a constitutional amendment called the No One Is Above the Law Amendment. It would make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office. I share our Founders‚Äô belief that the president‚Äôs power is limited, not absolute. We are a nation of laws‚Äînot of kings or dictators.

Second, we have had term limits for presidents for nearly 75 years. We should have the same for Supreme Court justices. The United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime seats to its high court. Term limits would help ensure that the court‚Äôs membership changes with some regularity. That would make timing for court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary. It would reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come. I support a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court.

Third, I‚Äôm calling for a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court. This is common sense. The court‚Äôs current voluntary ethics code is weak and self-enforced. Justices should be required to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Every other federal judge is bound by an enforceable code of conduct, and there is no reason for the Supreme Court to be exempt.

All three of these reforms are supported by a majority of Americans‚Äîas well as conservative and liberal constitutional scholars. In America, no one is above the law. In America, the people rule.",1722280620,"13,054","2,733","1,378","55,038"

Joe Biden,JoeBiden,Democratic,"President Biden: The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself. It was a state case, not a federal case. And it was heard by a jury of 12 citizens. 12 Americans, 12 people like you. Like millions of Americans who served on juries, this jury is chosen the same way every jury in America is chosen. It was a process that Donald Trump's attorney was part of. The jury heard five weeks of evidence. After careful deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous verdict. They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts. Now he‚Äôll be given the opportunity as he should to appeal that decision just like everyone else has that opportunity. That's how the American system of justice works. And it's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years and it literally is the cornerstone of America. The justice system should be respected, and we should never allow anyone to tear it down.

Greene,RepMTG,Republican,"I have co-sponsored every Article of Impeachment introduced in the House against unelected judges who believe they have the power to usurp Article II and override the authority of the duly elected President of the United States, chosen by a majority of the American people.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg recently ordered that deportation flights carrying Venezuelan gang members‚Äîcriminals responsible for the deaths of American citizens‚Äîbe turned around mid-flight.

This ruling is not just an affront to the millions of Americans who support President Trump‚Äôs mission to secure our country, it is entirely nonjusticiable.

President Trump is our Commander-in-Chief and was exercising the powers fully vested in him by Article II of the Constitution. No judge at any level, including the Supreme Court, can limit the constitutional powers granted to the President.

Issuing such a weaponized, politically motivated judgment in bad faith undermines the credibility of our entire judicial system and demands immediate action from Article I to defend and uphold Article II.

Impeachment and removal from office is the constitutionally prescribed remedy, and it is urgently needed.

Unfortunately, Judge Boasberg is not alone. Other judges have similarly issued political rulings designed to undercut President Trump and his administration.

No single District Court judge in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, or anywhere else has more authority than the Presidency.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve co-sponsored Articles of Impeachment against five federal judges so far. 

I‚Äôm also in support of legislative options to reign in rogue judges trying to play President. 

However, the easiest way to stop these rogue judges is for Congress to do our job and pass our own budget and policies through one big beautiful bill just like President Trump has asked us to.

M.T. Greene,RepMTG,Republican,"MAGA NATION, this post is for you, please read.

I know you because I‚Äôm one of you and we delivered a mandate which is President Trump‚Äôs America First agenda - the agenda he campaigned on at every rally he held and we attended across the country. 

Congress has to deliver that mandate with our budget reconciliation process, but some in Congress are developing amnesia to the very fact that YOU, the people, did not vote for them and their agenda, YOU voted for Trump and HIS agenda.

President Trump and his great team are delivering his campaign promises at record speed through his executive orders and DOGE.

President Trump is slashing regulations, destroying DEI, making the world respect America again through reciprocal tariffs, is in the process of ending world wars and America paying for them, has secured the border and begun deportations, is reducing the over bloated government workforce, and with Elon‚Äôs DOGE - they are literally exposing and dismantling the deep state‚Äôs government money laundering and out right fraud!  It‚Äôs been an AMAZING first month.

But we in Congress now have to deliver as well.

With the historic election. You would think Republicans would just whip up our bills, budget, and approps and pass them with ease, but nope, it‚Äôs so much harder than it should be.

President Trump wants one big beautiful bill and I prefer one as well, but we have to make sure HIS agenda is in that one big beautiful bill and there are a few items that some of my conservative colleagues don‚Äôt support. (Conservative doesn‚Äôt mean they supported Trump until they had to)

No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on Social Security were President Trump‚Äôs big campaign promises and some conservatives don‚Äôt want to include those when we renew the tax law - Trump‚Äôs Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

Those tax campaign promises help many Americans that need it the most as they have been hit hard by Biden and the Democrat‚Äôs high inflation over the past 4 years.  We are talking about senior‚Äôs and workers. 

So why, you ask, would some conservatives not support no tax on tips, overtime, and social security???

It‚Äôs because they are singularly focused on deeply cutting spending and some of them never supported Trump in the first place so they have no respect for the people‚Äôs mandate. Some of them simply don‚Äôt get it. And some of them think overly highly of themselves and their own plan.

Here is what they are missing, as well as some others in our Republican conference. 

With spending cuts, DOGE cuts, Trump‚Äôs de-regs, Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariffs, energy policies, we MUST renew TCJA WITH all of the no tax campaign promises because ALL OF THIS together will be like Elon‚Äôs rockets to our economy!!!

And it all will work together to drive revenue AND cut spending AND will deliver the mandate THE PEOPLE voted for!!!

Cutting spending is only one piece and believe me I‚Äôm all for it, but with our compounding interest now bigger than our military budget, we can‚Äôt cut our way out of this.

We have to increase revenue but not be so blind and stupid that we give tax breaks to corporations but NOT to desperately suffering workers and seniors!!!

Give money back to workers and seniors and they will spend it into the economy and will be thanking Republicans at the same time!!!

Increasing revenue will happen through reciprocal tariffs, killing the green new deal handouts and tax breaks and driving American energy (which will lower business cost and inflation), cutting the strangling regulations on businesses, and DOGE‚Äôs lethal attack on the deep state‚Äôs money laundering and fraud.

But for the love of God, help the people that need it most, get out of your own way, deliver TRUMP‚ÄôS agenda, and maybe just maybe we will win the midterms if we do this right.",1740071940,"2,177","2,861",309,"14,612"

An average of 300 Americans are murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes directly from China into Mexico and Canada then the Mexican cartels smuggle it into America through both borders.

Yes there are Mexican cartels operating in Canada now.

Canada and Mexico have not stopped the multi billion dollar Mexican cartels from the intense flow of human trafficking and drug trafficking across our southern border and northern border and China has not stopped sending poisonous fentanyl to the Mexican cartels to murder our people.

And it‚Äôs not just fentanyl, the horrifying effects of drug and human trafficking are the decay of our society, and Americans have been forced to pay for it all by our inept leaders. 

Shame on the governments of Canada, Mexico, and China for what they have done to America.

While trade accounts for 67% of Canada‚Äôs GDP, 73% of Mexico‚Äôs GDP, and 37%
of China‚Äôs GDP, it accounts for only 24% of U.S. GDP. However, in 2023 the U.S.

M.T. Greene,RepMTG,Republican,"Good morning.

After two days at our House Republican winter retreat, we still do not have a plan on budget reconciliation and our Speaker and his team have not offered one.

Not even if we are in a one bill or two bill framework, even though President Trump (who prefers one big beautiful bill) literally told us here at the start of our conference that he now does not care if it‚Äôs one or two.

Basically, just get started doing something.

We have only been presented with the same policy and budget cut proposals that we have been presented with for a month now at all our meetings and at a full Saturday conference meeting earlier this month.

I would say sink or swim, but our country is already sinking, so we MUST swim.

President Trump is leading the charge with unprecedented America FIRST executive orders. 

We should be writing our bills and budget reconciliation word for word to his executive orders so that they can become law and not stopped with Democrat lawsuits that are already piling up or a future Democrat administration that undoes them all with a stroke of the pen.

The American people elected Trump and are THRILLED with his executive orders and aggressive leadership that fights for America, and they want the entire Republican Party to DO THE SAME.

The American people demand Republicans deliver on the mandate and we should not be concerned about what CBO, who is left leaning and gets it wrong all the time, says. We should care what the people say and they don‚Äôt care what CBO says. 

And don‚Äôt worry, tax dollars did not pay for our conference retreat, we had to pay for it ourselves.

I would normally complain about spending money that didn‚Äôt accomplish anything, but we stayed at Trump Doral, which is a phenomenal resort, and the weather was sunny and in the 70‚Äôs.  And the Congressional Institute did a good job as always. 

Now the flag is at full mast.

I very much want House Republicans to be successful, all of us, with our razor thin majority.

Next time we meet, I hope to know a framework of our plan and I hope this doesn‚Äôt turn into another bill with thousands of pages dumped on us with less than 72 hours to read it all before we have to vote on the eve of another government shutdown.

This Wednesday, @GOPoversight  will hear from former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O‚ÄôMalley.

I‚Äôll be asking O‚ÄôMalley why he worked so hard to intentionally undermine the incoming Trump Administration during his final days as Commissioner.

Before submitting his resignation, O‚ÄôMalley locked in his agency‚Äôs telework policies through 2029.

This action was clearly designed to tie the hands of President Trump‚Äôs incoming administration, preventing them from getting federal employees back into the office to serve the American people‚Äîthe very people who pay their salaries.

If employees in the private sector were absent from work this much, they‚Äôd be fired.

O‚ÄôMalley could have allowed President Trump‚Äôs incoming administration to renegotiate union contracts‚Äîa more appropriate course of action given the election results. Instead, he chose to sabotage the transition on behalf of the Democrats.

M.T. Greene,RepMTG,Republican,"Good gracious, I came out of Christmas bliss to see arguments about American labor vs H1-B imported labor and MAGA split over this issue.

Good, that means everyone is engaged in saving this country.

Here is some tough reality for some of you:

There are some big MAGA voices with large social media platforms throwing down their opinions yet they have never run a company that relies on thousands of skilled/highly trained workers with a constant need for reliable labor yet they claim authority over the subject matter.

When you spend years trying to constantly hire/train/maintain a good reliable workforce, which is a 24/7 never ending cycle, your real world experience will produce an opinion based on reality and all of your followers on X don‚Äôt translate to this.

Having owned a construction company for decades (yes I‚Äôm that old), I know firsthand our workforce issues.

However, I fully believe we must make the hard and necessary changes here in the U.S. to educate, build, and facilitate a solid foundation of knowledgeable, highly skilled, talented, well paid, AMERICAN workers. 

Not having this is like having a crumbling foundation in our house and currently we are importing foreigners to hold up the foundation walls and plug the leaks. 

Too many of our young people, are killing their bodies and minds on alcohol and drugs, wasting years and money earning useless college degrees, chasing unrealistic dreams, spending all their time trying to be the next you tuber/content creator/social media influencer instead of pursuing a useful skill set/trade/education in order to become a part of our much needed American workforce. 

If you fall in this category, put down the selfie light, and go apply for a job and replace the H1-B visa holders and all the other skilled labor jobs that foreign workers are taking and American companies are desperately trying to hire.

It‚Äôs called building a career, you work your way up.

In order to go forward we must change our education system, create a culture that respects hard work and productivity, cut government waste/spending/regulations in order to produce a healthy robust economy that lowers inflation and pays higher wages to an American workforce, so that H1-B is no longer needed and can be done away with.

Decades of America LAST bad decisions in Washington wove a giant web of America LAST policies that created systems and structures that must be torn down and rebuilt to put America FIRST.

This requires everyone‚Äôs help to change it and we will all have to do what it takes to get it done.

After Johnson completely failed us by not including us in the planning of this year end‚Äôs government funding and then dumped a 1,500 page CRomnibus on us Tuesday night with little time to read it and got caught, in his scheme with Schumer, McConnell, and Hakeem, by all the great American people here on X along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, it was President Trump‚Äòs team, our incoming Vice President JD Vance, and then President Trump himself that dove in, in the midnight hour, and came up with a CR that solves the debt ceiling problem for President Trump, and even more importantly, helped hurricane victims, farmers, and would keep the government open.

I am very grateful to all the Americans who dove into reading the bill text along with Elon and Vivek and made their voices heard!

If you all keep reading all our bills, with your support and pressure, we can save our country! So thank you üôè 

To be clear, the 1,500+ pages released last night were added spending items on top of the CR (continuing resolution) of the 2023 two part omnibus. 

A clean 3 month CR would extend the policies and programs funded in the two part 2023 omnibus which totaled $1.66 trillion. So that CR (1/4 of total) would cost approx $415 billion.

Then you would have to add on the extra cost of the items in the 1,500 page bill from last night. We don‚Äôt know how much that is!

Just think about that. 

That‚Äôs how morally corrupt all of these people are.

Joe did not pardon Hunter because he is a father who loved his son like the mockingbird media and Democrat liars are saying.

Joe pardoned Hunter all the way back to 2014 when Hunter started bio labs in Ukraine, started with Burisma, and began money laundering through dozens of LLC shell companies through business deals in many foreign countries including China.

Hunter is not just Joe‚Äôs son, he is his business partner, and Hunter sold his Dad‚Äôs power and influence for millions while Joe was VP and beyond. 

That‚Äôs why the wide sweeping pardon from 2014 to now. 

It covers VP to 4 yrs running for president to 4 yrs being president - 11 years of all kinds of crimes.

But the bigger crimes are all the people in the FBI, DOJ, State Department, CIA, and other agencies that all knew about the Biden family corrupt business and crimes yet stayed quiet, provided cover, lied about it all, but instead went after their political enemies.

Matthew Perna was a non violent J6 defendant who tragically committed suicide under the unbearable weight of political persecution by U.S. attorney Matthew Graves from the DOJ.

Matthew Perna is not the only J6 defendant who committed suicide, sadly there are more.

I introduced the Matthew Perna Act, after Congressman Louie Ghomert left in order to stop political persecution in the justice system. There are no cosponsors.

M.T. Greene,RepMTG,Republican,"The War Machine.. 

I‚Äôll explain how it works and why I don‚Äôt vote for it.

The Defense Industrial Base is tax payer funded gov contracts with American companies to build weapons, ammunition, and military equipment - made in America with American jobs.

The pitch they give members of Congress and Senators is that we MUST vote for the annual defense budget and other programs in order to fund America‚Äôs military and defense of the United States of America.  

AND they always add how important these gov contracts are with American companies because they create jobs and continued funding protects these jobs.

They will also gladly show each of us a map of where these companies are, and number of jobs, in each of our districts or states, and to increase pressure on us they will throw in where military bases are in our districts.

This is implied understanding of how many votes that we could lose if we don‚Äôt vote YES to continue the funding for the defense contracts in our district and the number of military votes we could lose as well if we vote NO to military funding.

Of course add in the shaming of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt support the military?!‚Äù

Many appropriation bills contain gov contracts with the defense industrial base which currently is an economic driver created by a business model that is built on murder, war, and destruction in foreign countries around the world.

The reason why I adamantly oppose this business model is because of the way it works.

They give away the older weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to countries the U.S. supports in the name of defending democracy and beating the current bad guy, in order to create the need to sign new defense contracts to build new weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to replenish the old.

Of course, giving away old weapons and equipment to countries like Ukraine comes with U.S. ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù on how to use these deadly gifts against their enemies, which also requires more funding. 

This is all in the name of ‚Äúresponsibility.‚Äù

This bloody business model creates an annual defense budget of over $850 billion per year, but that‚Äôs just the starter package. 

Funding foreign wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, and all the rest actually have cost the American people TRILLIONS of their hard earned tax dollars that comes with the ‚Äúreasons‚Äù of creating American jobs and replenishing America‚Äôs military and to support the Military Industrial Economic Base.

When you combine the reality of American tax payers enslaved in debt by paying for murder and war in foreign lands that don‚Äôt affect us with stupid decisions by politicians and unelected bureaucrats that led us to $36 trillion in debt which has driven life to be unaffordable, open border policies that have empowered the international criminal cartels trafficking drugs, people, and killing Americans, crumbling infrastructure, dying prosperity and hope for young Americans, and the dumbing down of our youth through failing education and immoral cultural norms, this is why I adamantly OPPOSE and will FIGHT against this evil insanity.

You see when our self righteous government claims to defend freedom and democracy around the world, by regime change with its almighty military forces and strength, boasting about the taxpayer funded Military Industrial Economic Base, while virtually kicking the hard working American people in the gut every damn day making them pay for it all, while simultaneously not defending our own border, the people hate the government and it‚Äôs pathetic little shills in the media.

Today‚Äôs passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes important wins for our troops and ensures our military has the necessary resources and support to defend our great nation.¬†Our men and women in uniform should know their first obligation is protecting our nation, not woke ideology. It‚Äôs disappointing to see 124 of my Democrat colleagues vote against our brave men and women in uniform over policies that have nothing to do with their intended mission.
¬†
That is why this year‚Äôs NDAA refocuses our military on its core mission of defending America. The legislation supports law enforcement operations and the deployment of the National Guard to the southwest border, expedites innovation and reduces the acquisition timeline for new weaponry, supports our allies, and strengthens our nuclear posture and missile defense programs.
¬†
Because we believe in peace through strength, we blocked the Biden Administration's plan to reduce the number of US special forces. We remain determined to confront increasingly hostile threats from Communist China, Russia, and Iran, and this legislation provides our military with the tools they need to deter our enemies and keep America safe.
¬†
We also believe it‚Äôs important to refocus the Pentagon on military lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.
¬†
This legislation also reinforces our commitment to America‚Äôs brave men and women in uniform, and their families, by making landmark investments in their quality of life. I‚Äôm proud that we‚Äôre providing significant pay increases to our servicemembers, reducing barriers to employment for military spouses, and improving military housing and access to childcare.

Many people don‚Äôt know this, but Rockwell actually lived for a time in Arlington, Vermont, and painted some of his most well-known pieces there, including his ‚ÄúFour Freedoms.‚Äù He even used many of his Vermont neighbors as models and inspiration in his work.

Rockwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúFour Freedoms‚Äù series was published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1943. They were paintings that reflected the vision that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt articulated in his 1941 State of the Union speech: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear.  

In that speech Roosevelt stated:

‚ÄúIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.

‚ÄúThe first is freedom of speech and expression‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe third is freedom from want‚Äîwhich, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe fourth is freedom from fear‚Äîwhich, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor‚Äîanywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThat is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.‚Äù

Donald Trump,realDonaldTrump,Republican,"Today, President Donald J. Trump agreed to withdraw his March 14, 2025 Executive Order regarding the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP law firm (‚ÄúPaul, Weiss‚Äù), which has entered into the following agreement with the President:
 
1. Paul, Weiss agrees that the bedrock principle of American Justice is that it must be fair and nonpartisan for all. Our Justice System is betrayed when it is misused to achieve political ends.
Lawyers and law firms play a vital role in ensuring that we live up to that standard as a Nation. Law firms should not favor any political party when it comes to choosing their clients. Firms also should not make decisions on whom to hire based on a person‚Äôs political affiliation. To do otherwise is to deny some Americans an equal opportunity for our services while favoring others.  
Lawyers abandon the profession‚Äôs highest ideals when they engage in partisan decision-making, and betray the ethical obligation to represent those who are unpopular or disfavored in a particular environment.  
2. Paul, Weiss affirms its unwavering commitment to these core ideals and principles, and will not deny representation to clients, including in pro bono matters and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.  
3. Paul, Weiss will take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society, whether ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal.‚Äù
4. Paul, Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, and will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies. As part of its commitment, it will engage experts, to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days, to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.
5. Paul, Weiss will dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump‚Äôs term to support the Administration‚Äôs initiatives, including: assisting our Nation‚Äôs veterans, fairness in the Justice System, the President‚Äôs Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.
Statement from the White House: ‚ÄúThe President is agreeing to this action in light of a meeting with Paul, Weiss Chairman, Brad Karp, during which Mr. Karp acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul, Weiss partner, Mark Pomerantz, the grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice.‚Äù
In response to the President‚Äôs announcement, Paul, Weiss‚Äôs Chairman Brad Karp said: ‚ÄúWe are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss.

They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.
Joe Biden‚Äôs response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.
The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.
Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists‚Äô bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.
To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON‚ÄôT, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!
To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY!

Today, I am honored to announce that I am nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan ‚ÄúRazin‚Äù Caine to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Caine is an accomplished pilot, national security expert, successful entrepreneur, and a ‚Äúwarfighter‚Äù with significant interagency and special operations experience.
 
During my first term, Razin was instrumental in the complete annihilation of the ISIS caliphate. It was done in record setting time, a matter of weeks. Many so-called military ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù said it would take years to defeat ISIS. General Caine, on the other hand, said it could be done quickly, and he delivered.
 
Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration, General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore! Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth, General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength, put America First, and rebuild our military. Finally, I have also directed Secretary Hegseth to solicit nominations for five additional high level positions, which will be announced soon.

For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.
For many years, the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other Countries, both friend and foe. This System will immediately bring Fairness and Prosperity back into the previously complex and unfair System of Trade. America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly ‚Äì A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.

Donald Trump,realDonaldTrump,Republican,"On Trade, I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them - No more, no less!
For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.
For many years, the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other Countries, both friend and foe. This System will immediately bring Fairness and Prosperity back into the previously complex and unfair System of Trade. America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly ‚Äì A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.

We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other‚Äôs Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!

Donald Trump,realDonaldTrump,Republican,"Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, while destroying their families and communities all across our Country.
Canada will implement their $1.3 Billion Border plan, and as per Prime Minister Trudeau, will be, ‚Äúreinforcing the Border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are, and will be, working on protecting the Border. In addition, Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the Border, launch a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering. I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl, and we will be backing it with $200 million.‚Äù
As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.

Donald Trump,realDonaldTrump,Republican,"I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù between our two Countries.",1738597260.0,6410,14.9k,,70.4k
